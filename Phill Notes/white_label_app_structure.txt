WHITE-LABEL APP STRUCTURE – REFERENCE DOCUMENT
==============================================

GOAL:
Create a scalable white‑label system where multiple companies get their own branded version of your design/configurator app WITHOUT maintaining multiple codebases.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. SINGLE SHARED CODEBASE
------------------------------------------------------------
• You write the app ONCE.  
• All companies run their own “instance” of the same code.  
• Differences between companies come from configuration files, not different versions of code.

This prevents duplication and makes updates easy.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. CONFIG FILES (PER COMPANY)
------------------------------------------------------------
Each company gets its own config folder (example: /configs/companyA).

Configs may include:
• Colors  
• Logos  
• Feature flags  
• Product lists  
• Branding  
• Tooling options  
• Pricing rules  
• Anything custom per client  

The app loads a different config depending on which company is logging in.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. AUTHENTICATION OPTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
There are two main ways to do authentication:

### OPTION A – ONE GLOBAL LOGIN (Single Sign-On)
• Only ONE login service exists.  
• All companies authenticate against the same system.  
• Cleaner, simpler, easier to maintain.  
• Users are separated by tenant/company IDs.

### OPTION B – SEPARATE AUTH INSTANCES PER COMPANY
• Each company gets its own login portal.  
• More isolated, more private, more “white‑label pure.”  
• Slightly more setup per company.  
• You still use the SAME AUTH CODEBASE, but deploy it multiple times.

This is what you want for PAC white‑label setups.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. ADMIN DASHBOARD FOR CONFIGS
------------------------------------------------------------
Instead of digging through code, you will have a visual Admin Dashboard that lets you:

• Select which company you’re editing  
• Use dropdowns to change branding (logos, colors)  
• Toggle features on/off  
• Change product lists  
• Adjust tool groups  
• Save configuration safely  

This makes the system accessible and prevents editing JSON files manually.

This dashboard can be built later — the important thing is that the architecture allows it.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. HOW BIG COMPANIES DO THIS
------------------------------------------------------------
Major SaaS and white‑label systems follow this pattern:

• One central codebase  
• Per‑client configurations  
• Optional per‑client auth instances  
• Visual config dashboard  
• Automated deployments per client  

You are building a simplified version of the same proven pattern.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. WHAT TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THIS
------------------------------------------------------------
When you're ready to implement:

(1) You’ll create a repo for the *main app*.  
(2) You’ll create a repo for the *auth service* (reusable across companies).  
(3) Each new company gets:
    • A config folder  
    • (Optional) a deployed auth instance  
    • A deployed version of the main app reading their config  
(4) The Admin Dashboard will read/write config files visually.

------------------------------------------------------------
This is the full architectural baseline for your future PAC apps.
Save this file and refer back when you start building authentication or deployment.
