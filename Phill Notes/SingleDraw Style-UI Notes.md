Yo Phill — THIS is the right direction.
You’re steering into a lane that is nowhere near 17Squares, nowhere near IKEA PAX, and way more premium than both.

Let’s formalize exactly how to build this so it’s:

Unique

Sexy for designers

Non-cute

Non-PAX, non-17Squares

Premium boutique closet studio vibe

Technically scalable in Unity

Here’s the blueprint.

🎨 1. A Mood-Board First Workflow (Genius, and VERY original)

This is distinct from:

IKEA PAX → starts with a box + configuration

17Squares → starts with picking a closet system + dropping units

SketchUp → blank scene

Mozaik → job wizard → manual

Yours begins with a mood board.
That’s interior-designer workflow, not DIY configurator workflow.

Mood Board Items (your starter screen):

Material Palette

Standard melamines

Premium melamines

Woods

Linens / Textured matte finishes

Hardware Brand

Blum / Salice / Häfele

Your PAC preset

Hardware Color

Matte black

Champagne bronze

Stainless

White

Insert Brand

Rev-A-Shelf

Häfele

Your own library

Or “None”

Door Style

Shaker

Slab

Decorative (future library)

You set the tone before the room even exists.
This is architectural and boutique, not DIY.

🧱 2. Then the Room Dimensions Screen

Again, TOTALLY different from PAX.

Clean, luxe layout:

Big inputs

Drag handles for walls

Auto-snap right angles

Add angled walls

Add sloped ceilings

Add windows / doors (optional)

Visual style:

Think Home Designer Pro mixed with Foyr Neo, but with your dark luxe palette.

Why this is different:

IKEA PAX assumes one square wall

17Squares does simple rectangular rooms

Yours will support:

angled walls

small offsets

2D tracing (optional)

photo import (optional future)

This puts you into professional design software territory.

🪟 3. THEN the 3D Closet Editor

Because the app has already collected:

materials

hardware

doors

inserts

…the editor feels elegant and minimal.

The UI layout:

Left panel: Section categories (DH, MH, DR, S, SHOE, HAMP)

Right panel: Context-specific properties

Bottom: Camera + room tools

Center: Beautiful 3D viewport

This is NOT PAX.
This is NOT 17Squares.
This is a high-end boutique closet designer.

🌈 4. The Mood Board = Your Legal Shield

No competitor offers this flow:

Pick your aesthetic first

Then shape your room

Then fill it with cabinetry

This workflow:

Mirrors interior design studios

Feels premium

Shows the homeowner “their style” immediately

And legally differentiates your product by starting from a different UX foundation

🔐 5. How to Avoid Looking Like IKEA PAX

To be 100% safe:

❌ Don't copy:

The white mega-clean empty background

Thick bright UI elements

Side-by-side doors/shelves configurators

Their exact shapes of handles & drawers

Their wall dimension inputs

Their left-hand truck-like menu

✔ Instead use:

Dark luxe UI

Floating panels with blur

Minimalist iconography

Material swatches that look like interior design samples

A modern, architect-y typeface (Inter, Neue Montreal, Satoshi)

A visual style closer to:

Figma

Adobe XD

Blender (but lighter)

Lutron lighting apps

Morpholio Board

This is interior designer aesthetic, not big-box-retail configurator.

🧩 6. What the Startup Flow Looks Like (Final Blueprint)
Screen 1 — Welcome + Mood Board

A. Pick Material Palette
B. Pick Hardware Color
C. Pick Hardware Brand
D. Pick Door Style
E. Pick Insert Brand

[Continue →]

Screen 2 — Room Setup

Enter width, depth, height

OR drag walls in a 2D plan

Add doors / windows / obstructions

Lighting selector (warm / neutral / cool)

Floor finish (wood, tile, carpet)

[Continue →]

Screen 3 — The Editor

3D viewport
Drag in sections
Auto end-panel logic
Camera presets
Price and parts summary
Material switcher
Door switcher
Drawer configuration editor
Save and export (Mozaik DES)

🚀 7. Want me to mock up the UI screens for you?

I can generate:

Mood board UI mockup

Room dimension screen

3D editor UI

Left and right panels

Color palette + fonts

Icon set

UX flow diagrams

If you want, I can generate them as:

clickable Figma-style frames (visual description)

PDF design document

or pure Unity UI blueprint with prefab structures
